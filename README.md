# grunt-ftpush

This is a [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) task for code deployment over the _ftp_ protocol. Being rewrite of [grunt-ftp-deploy](https://github.com/zonak/grunt-ftp-deploy) it works incrementally unlike its predecessor. It mirrors remote location to the given local location removing excess directories and files. Additionally it tries to intellectually upload only changed files.

**NOTE**: with the limited abilities of FTP, the only adequate way to track changes is to track them locally. It means that each run will compare set of files **to the previous run** and not the server state. Therefore:

  * The first run will upload everything since we have no idea what's the state of a server. Current state will be saved to `.grunt/ftpush`.
  * If there are two users that deploy (or you use multiple machines), it will increment _all_ local changes. It can be considered safe but you might end up uploading a bit more.
  * To make it reupload from the scratch, delete files located at `.grunt/ftpush/*`.

## Usage

To use this task you will need to include the following configuration in your _grunt_ file:

```javascript
ftpush: {
  build: {
    auth: {
      host: 'server.com',
      port: 21,
      authKey: 'key1'
    },
    src: 'path/to/source/folder',
    dest: '/path/to/destination/folder',
    exclusions: ['path/to/source/folder/**/.DS_Store', 'path/to/source/folder/**/Thumbs.db', 'dist/tmp']
    keep: ['/important/images/at/server/*.jpg']
  }
}
```

and load the task:

```javascript
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-ftpush');
```

The parameters in our configuration are:

- **host** - the name or the IP address of the server we are deploying to
- **port** - the port that the _ftp_ service is running on
- **authKey** - a key for looking up the saved credentials. If no value is defined, the `host` parameter will be used
- **src** - the source location, the local folder that we are transferring to the server
- **dest** - the destination location, the folder on the server we are deploying to
- **exclusions** - an optional parameter allowing us to exclude files and folders by utilizing grunt's support for `minimatch`. Please note that the definitions should be relative to the project root
- **keep** - an array of paths that should be kept on the server even when they are not presented locally. The definitions should be relative to `dest`.

## Options

The only possible option is: `--simple`. If given, task will upload modified files and quit, it will NOT remove redundant files and directories at the server side.

## Authentication parameters

Usernames and passwords are stored as a JSON object in a file named `.ftppass`. This file should be located in the same folder as your `Gruntfile`. `.ftppass` should have the following format:

```javascript
{
  "key1": {
    "username": "username1",
    "password": "password1"
  },
  "key2": {
    "username": "username2",
    "password": "password2"
  }
}
```

This way we can save as many username / password combinations as we want and look them up by the `authKey` value defined in the _grunt_ config file where the rest of the target parameters are defined.

**IMPORTANT**: make sure that the `.ftppass` file uses double quotes (which is the proper _JSON_ syntax) instead of single quotes for the names of the keys and the string values.

## Kudos

This task is a fork of [grunt-ftp-deploy](https://github.com/zonak/grunt-ftp-deploy) by [zonak](https://github.com/zonak).

It also is built by taking advantage of the great work of Sergi Mansilla and his [jsftp](https://github.com/sergi/jsftp) _node.js_ module and suited for the **0.4.x** branch of _grunt_.
